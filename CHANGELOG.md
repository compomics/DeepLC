## [1.1.2] - 2022-04-06

### Changed
- Made Gooey an optional dependency (facilitates install on Linux). Install the optional
dependencies for the graphical user interface with `pip install deeplc[gui]`

## [1.1.1] - 2022-04-03

### Added
- New native Python GUI, based on the Gooey package
- New standalone installer for Windows using PyInstaller and Inno Setup
- Added `deeplc-gui` entrypoint to start GUI from the command line

### Changed
- CLI: Restructured help message
- Made DeepLC class API docstring consistent with CLI help message
- Docs: Moved `dict_divider` and `split_cal` explanation to README Q&A section.
- CI: Only run tests on commits to `master` or from a PR
- Refactoring: Cleaned up `__main__.py`
- Logging: Changed some loggings from DEBUG to INFO level, some from WARNING to INFO or
DEBUG level

### Removed
- Removed Java-based GUI in favor of new Python-based GUI

### Fixed
- If run through CLI/GUI, all Tensorflow warnings are now fully suppressed
- Added `--legacy_calibration` CLI option to allow for old piecewise linear calibration
while new pyGAM calibration method is default. `--legacy_calibration` is mutually
exclusive with `--pygam_calibration`.
